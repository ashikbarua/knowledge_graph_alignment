# Knowledge graph alignment

Knowledge graph alignment(KGA) is the process of discovering mappings, i.e. to find out equivalent relations, entities and others; between two or more knowledge graphs(KG). The matching between the graphs can be entitiy based or lexical matching based systems. KGs apply semantics to give context and relationships to data which provides a framework for data integration, unification, analytics and sharing . Graph powered applications can help to discover facts from content, data and organizational knowledge, and could potentially lead to build a more robust and reliable system.

Here, we developed a `supervised network alignment approach` to discover mappings between equivalent entities and relations.
